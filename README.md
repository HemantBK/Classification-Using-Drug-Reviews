## Patient's Condition Classification Using Drug Reviews
This repository contains a data science project that focuses on text classification. The project aims to classify patient's conditions using drug reviews and ratings.

### Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:

1) data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
2) notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3) models/: This directory is used to store trained models.
4) src/: This directory contains the source code for the project, including data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation scripts.
5) requirements.txt: This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
6) README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.

### Getting Started
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-professional-project.git.
2) Navigate to the project directory: cd data-science-professional-project.
3) Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended): python -m venv venv (or use your preferred method for creating virtual environments).
4) Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (for Unix-based systems) or venv\Scripts\activate (for Windows).
5) Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
6) Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.
7) Alternatively, you can directly use the scripts in the src/ directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as per your requirements.

   
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of drug reviews and ratings, along with the corresponding patient's condition. The dataset is located in the data/ directory of this repository.

### Model
The project employs various machine learning algorithms for text classification, including but not limited to:

Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest

The models are implemented in Python using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and NLTK.

### Results
The project aims to achieve accurate classification of patient's conditions based on drug reviews. The evaluation metrics used for model performance include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results of the experiments can be found in the Jupyter notebooks or the evaluation scripts in the src/ directory.
